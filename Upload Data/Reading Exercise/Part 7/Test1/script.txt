Dear Ms. Johnson,

District Management at Topline Electronics would like to inform you about a new development that will be affecting your store. Another competing consumer electronics store will be opening in the Crayville area on November 12.

In order to ensure that Topline Electronics does not lose business to this new store, District Management is advising you to run a special sale on our new line of curved UHD televisions. These televisions provide state-of-the-art features at moderate prices. By showing your customers that Topline Electronics offers the best deals in the area, you will be able to maintain customer loyalty. We will be shipping the new televisions to your store within the next week. We suggest you prepare a prominent display space in your store to feature them. You should also update your website to advertise the sale.

Smooth communication between you and US is vital to effective operational practices. If you have any questions concerning the new televisions or the marketing campaign in general, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact District Management.

Sincerely,

Josh Fleck District Manager,
Topline Electronics
