# Câu Gián Tiếp (Reported Speech)

## 1. Định nghĩa
Câu gián tiếp (*Reported Speech*) là cách tường thuật lại lời nói của người khác mà không dùng dấu ngoặc kép `" "`. Khi chuyển từ câu trực tiếp sang câu gián tiếp, chúng ta cần thay đổi động từ, đại từ, và trạng từ chỉ thời gian nếu cần thiết.

Ví dụ:  
- **Câu trực tiếp:** She said, "I am happy."  
- **Câu gián tiếp:** She said that she was happy.

## 2. Quy tắc chuyển đổi từ câu trực tiếp sang câu gián tiếp

### 2.1. Thay đổi thì của động từ
| Câu trực tiếp (Direct Speech) | Câu gián tiếp (Reported Speech) |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Present Simple → Past Simple | "I **like** apples," she said. → She said she **liked** apples. |
| Present Continuous → Past Continuous | "I **am working**," he said. → He said he **was working**. |
| Present Perfect → Past Perfect | "I **have finished**," she said. → She said she **had finished**. |
| Past Simple → Past Perfect | "I **went** to the park," he said. → He said he **had gone** to the park. |

### 2.2. Thay đổi đại từ
| Câu trực tiếp | Câu gián tiếp |
|--------------|--------------|
| "I like it." | He said **he** liked it. |
| "We will go." | They said **they** would go. |
| "You must help me." | She said **I** must help **her**. |

### 2.3. Thay đổi trạng từ chỉ thời gian và nơi chốn
| Trực tiếp | Gián tiếp |
|-----------|----------|
| now → then | "I am busy **now**." → He said he was busy **then**. |
| today → that day | "I will do it **today**." → She said she would do it **that day**. |
| yesterday → the day before | "I went there **yesterday**." → He said he had gone there **the day before**. |
| tomorrow → the next day | "I will call you **tomorrow**." → She said she would call me **the next day**. |
